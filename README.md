# Image Classification using MobileNetV2

Here is a demonstration of how to use the pre-trained MobileNetV2 model from TensorFlow to classify images. We will load a series of images, preprocess them, and then use the model to predict the top classes for each image.

#### 1. Loading the Pre-trained Model
The MobileNetV2 model is pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset, which contains millions of labeled images across thousands of classes. When you load the pre-trained MobileNetV2 model in TensorFlow, it already contains learned patterns and features from these images.

#### 2. Image Preprocessing
Before feeding an image into the model for prediction, it needs to be preprocessed. This typically involves resizing the image to the dimensions expected by the model (in this case, 224x224 pixels for MobileNetV2) and applying any necessary normalization or transformations. The `input_img` function in your code handles this preprocessing.

#### 3. Model Prediction
Once the image is preprocessed, it is passed through the pre-trained MobileNetV2 model using the `model.predict` method. This model consists of a deep neural network with multiple layers, including convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers. As the image passes through these layers, the model extracts features at different levels of abstraction.

#### 4. Decoding Predictions
The output of the model prediction is a set of numerical values representing the probabilities of the image belonging to each class in the ImageNet dataset. The `get_prediction` function decodes these numerical predictions into human-readable labels (class names) along with their corresponding probabilities. It uses the `decode_predictions` function provided by the MobileNetV2 module to map the numerical predictions to class labels.

#### 5. Displaying Predictions
Once the predictions are obtained, the `printing_predictions` function displays the original image along with the top predicted classes and their probabilities. This allows you to visually inspect the model's predictions and confidence levels.

In summary, the MobileNetV2 model recognizes images by leveraging its pre-trained knowledge of features learned from the ImageNet dataset. It processes the input image through its layers, extracts relevant features, and produces predictions about the content of the image based on those features. The predictions are then decoded and presented to the user, along with confidence scores for each predicted class.
